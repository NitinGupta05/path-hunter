pathhunter 

An advanced pathfinding algorithm visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides an interactive way to understand how graph traversal algorithms work through real-time animations, dynamic grid interaction, and multiple visual themes — all running fully in the browser.

Features

Interactive grid-based pathfinding visualization
- Real-time visualization of algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- A* Search Algorithm

Grid interaction tools:
- Drag start and target nodes
- Draw walls using pencil tool
- Remove walls using eraser tool

Maze & pattern generation:
- Random DFS maze generation
- Spiral pattern
- Recursive division maze
- Visualization insights
- Nodes visited count
- Path length
- Execution status (success / failure)

UI & experience:
- Multiple map themes (Abstract, City, Jungle, Water)
- Dark / light theme toggle
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive and user-friendly layout
- Dedicated About page with algorithm explanations
- All logic runs client-side in pure JavaScript.
